    <h1>Description of API Used:</h1>
    <p>
      I chose the funtranslations API from https://funtranslations.com/api/. 
      API Request Parameters: For this example, I used the Pirate Translator to translate from
      English to Pirate English. The API request included the parameter `text` with
      the value "Hello, world!" to be translated into pirate language.The translation API could
      be useful to create a language learning app such as testing individuals for correct
      translations or other uses. Additionally, you could use the API to for fun game features.
      For instance, if you wanted to communicate in multiplayer with someone that write in a 
      different language, the text could be translated to your designated language.
